## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies** (if not done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open browser**: http://localhost:3000

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## 🎨 Key Technologies

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Monaco Editor**: Professional code editor
- **Excalidraw**: Drawing canvas
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **Lucide React**: Beautiful icons

## ✨ What Works Now

1. ✅ Switch between Split/Code/Draw views
2. ✅ Resize panels in split view
3. ✅ Write and edit code with syntax highlighting
4. ✅ Change programming language
5. ✅ Change editor theme
6. ✅ Draw on canvas with professional tools
7. ✅ Save sessions to browser storage
8. ✅ Load previously saved sessions
9. ✅ Export code as files
10. ✅ Clean, professional UI
